**Language**: C++

This tool creates a scene root dummy with a single click.

In 3ds Max, moving or rotating an entire scene is not as simple as selecting all objects, due to hierarchies, Physique-linked meshes, and link constraint controllers. These dependencies make global transformations difficult.

To solve this, animators usually create a root node that controls all scene objects (except Physique meshes and nodes with link constraints) and then move or rotate the scene using this root node. This plugin automatically creates such a root node in seconds.

---------
Overview
---------

 If you need to move or rotate whole scene in 3ds max, you can't just select all 
objects and move or rotate them. There are hierarchy, physique linked meshes 
and link constraint controller which make this impossible. Usually animator 
creates root node for all objects in scene, except for physique meshes and 
link controller assigned nodes, and moves scene by moving this root node. 

 This plugin can make root node for a scene automatically with a single click.

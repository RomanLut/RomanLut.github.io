FlyCamera - a plugin for 3DS MAX 4.x-6.x that allows you to move the camera using cursor control keys.

After installing the plugin to the "3dsmax\plugins\" directory, the "FlyCamera" category appears in the User Interface customization dialog (Customize -> Customize User Interface..) with the following list of actions:

FlyCameraForward        Ctrl+Shift+Up Arrow
FlyCameraBackward       Ctrl+Shift+Down Arrow
FlyCameraLeft           Ctrl+Shift+Left Arrow
FlyCameraRight          Ctrl+Shift+Right Arrow
FlyCameraUp             Ctrl+Shift+Home
FlyCameraDown           Ctrl+Shift+End
FlyCameraStrafeLeft     Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Left Arrow
FlyCameraStrafeRight    Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Right Arrow
FlyCameraCW             Ctrl+Shift+PgUp
FlyCameraCCW            Ctrl+Shift+PgDn
FlyCameraStrafeUp       Ctrl+Shift+A
FlyCameraStrafeDown     Ctrl+Shift+Z
FlyCameraIncreaseSpeed  Ctrl+Shift+Plus
FlyCameraDecreaseSpeed  Ctrl+Shift+Minus

You need to manually assign your own key combination to each action (you can assign them however you prefer; the above is just an example).

After that, you can move a "Free camera" object named "FlyCamera" by simply pressing and holding the assigned key combinations.

For the best experience, it is recommended to configure your keyboard settings (Control Panel -> Keyboard) to maximum key repeat rate and minimum delay before repeat.

When invoking the FlyCameraIncreaseSpeed and FlyCameraDecreaseSpeed actions, the current movement speed is displayed in the bottom-left corner of the 3DS MAX window (log).

If there is no object named "FlyCamera" in the scene, pressing any of the assigned key combinations will cause the plugin to automatically create a "Free camera" at coordinates 0,0,0, name it "FlyCamera", assign it to the Viewport, and even wash the dishes and take out the trash — allowing you to start exploring a newly loaded scene immediately without any unnecessary mouse movements.

Certain parameters (speed, acceleration, etc.) can be modified directly in the script text (descriptions are provided there).

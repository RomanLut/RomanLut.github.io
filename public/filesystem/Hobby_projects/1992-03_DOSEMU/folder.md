**DOSEMU**

**Date:** 1992-1993
**Platform:** Poisk-1, NO OS !
**Language:** Pure 8086 Assembler

The low-cost IBM-compatible PC called **POISK-1**, developed by the Ukrainian company **ElectronMash** in 1992, became a memorable milestone in the lives of many people. Its significance is comparable to the emergence of the ZX Spectrum series.

**Poisk-1** has modularized architecture. Base module has been limited to CPU, RAM and integrated Video Card. All software were loaded from tape recorder. During a year I ported about 30 games to cassette. When loaded from cassette, there is no operating system – only pure BIOS. INT21 and other interrupts should be emulated by a small stub – DOSEMU. DOSEMU did the good job with a lot of games, and even made possible making savegame to cassette – f.e. with ELITE.

Cassetes and source code was lost 🙁

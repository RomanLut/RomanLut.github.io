 TMyFile library is available to download at http://www.deep-shadows.com/hax/ReadManiac.htm.

 To access ZIP files, TMyFile library requires:

 I sligtly modified above library to work correctly with ZIP archive compression
and to be able to compile it with Borland JBuilder. This modified version is
included in this archive.

 Package includes JEnable preprocessor

 About
===================== 

 TMyFile class hierarchy provides unified access to contents of files of various formats.

Suported access options:
- create/delete/list/read/write binary files on MMC card (Siemens only) or RecordStore(others);
- read binary files from Midlet resources;
- read uncompressed contents of PDB, PRC and TCR files;
- read uncompresed contents of ZIP files, including ZIP file list.

 Note that this library can only uncompress, but not compress files.

Examples:

 Open binary file:
   TMyFile file = TMyFile.OpenFile("a:\\text.txt");
   file.Seek(...);
   file.Read(...);
   file.Close();

 Get list of files on MMC card (or RecordStore, see TMyMMCFile notes below):
  String[] list = TMyFile.list("a:\\");

 Open PDB or PRC file:
   TMyFile file = TMyFile.OpenFile("a:\\text.pdb");
   file.Seek(...);
   file.Read(...);
   file.Close();
   Reading file contents will return uncompressed contents.
   Only PalmDoc files are supported (iSilo not supported).

 Open PDB file in binary mode:
  TMyFile = new TMyMMCFile("a:\\file.pdb");
   file.Seek(...);
   file.Read(...);
   file.Close();
   Reading file contents will return compressed contents.

 Open  TCR file:
   TMyFile file = TMyFile.OpenFile("a:\\text.tcr");
   Reading file contents will return uncompressed contents.
   Note, that opening TCR file first time requires indexing, 
   and "Open" operation can take a lot of time
   (Check file.getProgress() and file.AbortReadOperation() methods).

 Open binary file inside ZIP archive:
   TMyFile file = TMyFile.OpenFile("a:\\archive.zip,text.txt");
   Reading file contents will return uncompressed contents.

   This file can be accessed just like general file - seeking, reading etc. 
  But note, that seeking backwards or far forward will generally require 
  uncompressing a lot of data = slowdown. ZIP file can be efficiently read only
  as a non-seeking stream, so knowing this fact can help to understand what 
  hapends behind curtains.
   TMyZipFile DOES NOT uncompress whole file into memory, so archive and files 
  inside it can have any size.
   Since Read() operation can take a long time, it is possible to present 
  current progress to user - call file.getProgress() from other thread;
  also check "file.AbortReadOperation();"

 Getting list of ZIP archive:
  String[] list = TMyZipFile.List("a:\\archive.zip");


 About TMyMMCFile: midlet can access phone's filesystem only on Siemens phones.
The only available storage space for midlet on other phones is RecordStore.
RecordStore provides API for storing blocks of data.
TMyMMCFile also can provide unified file-like access to RecordStore.
I use JEnable preprocessor. You will need to use JEnable to uncomment
TMyMMCFile implementation based on RecordStore: disabled options: "MIDP10",
disabled: "SIEMENS". Or just uncomment by hand.

====================
 How to build
====================  

 Build a small example how to use TMyFile hierarchy with "Build.bat".
 Example is for Siemens phones, and requres SMTK with any 65-series emulator.
 Please change pathes in build.bat before using.
 (see "Source\Displayable1.java");
 Install ZIPExamlple jar, jad and zip to a:\java\jam\ZIPExample\ directory on phone.

 This example also available as Borland JBuilder project (requires MobileSet) - 
 ZIPExample.jpx.


 At general, I do not have enought time to write good documentation and
build a good library. This is just a sources that "just work", and can be 
used as a starting point.


=============================
 Side notes on ZIP files
=============================

 I do not have code for creating new ZIP files. You will have to write it yourself. 

Here are the hints: 

ZIP file contents are as follows:

header

--- repeat ---
local file header
compressed stream
--- repeat ---

global directory header

--- repeat ---
global directory item
--- repeat ---

end tag


 So you have to write headers as described in ZIPFormat.txt, and write compressed stream,
made with Deflate() method.
 I also included SciZipFile.pas - an example how to handle ZIP archives in pascal.
Many other examples can be found in Google for "ZLIB". I just want to make it clear:
ZIP is not a ZLIB. Various ports of ZLIB may not contain code for handling ZIP files.
ZLIB are used to create compressed streams. ZIP are archive file format,
and files inside this archive are stored as compressed streams, produced by ZLIB.

 I hope this helps :)


---------------------------------------
 About weird comments like:

//#SIEMENS{

 - I use JEnable preprocessor for java (Google for "JEnable").

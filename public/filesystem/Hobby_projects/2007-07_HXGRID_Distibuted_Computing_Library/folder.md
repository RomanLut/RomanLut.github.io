**hxGrid**

**Date**: 2007
**Platform**: Windows
**Language**: Delphi, C++

**hxGrid** is a distributed computing library designed for small office environments. It enables the transparent use of idle processing time on Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7 workstations, without interfering with normal user activity.

The **ATI NormalMapper** tool was adapted for hxGrid, resulting in up to a 20x performance improvement. The library was also used in the **xNormal** tool (http://www.xnormal.net/
).

**hxGrid** is written in Delphi and can be used from both Delphi and C++, with example projects included.

The library is known to have been used by several game development companies to distribute and accelerate game level compilation tasks.

**SendToPDA**

**Date:** 2003
**Platform:** Windows XP
**Language:** Delphi 6.0

In 2003, Android did not exist, and Palm PCs were popular. These were small, handheld devices capable of running applications and were controlled by the Palm OS operating system.

This folder contains a GUI for the iSiloX converter. It adds a “Send to PDA” option to the right-click context menu for HTM, HTML, TXT, RTF, and DOC files. The tool automatically handles all dialog steps, allowing you to send files to a Palm device in just two clicks.

**Palm PDAs** are completely outdated now.

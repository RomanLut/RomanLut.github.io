**3D Ripper DX**

**Date:** 2006
**Platform:** Windows
**Language:** C++, Assembly

3D Ripper DX captures frame geometry, textures, and shaders from DirectX 6.0-9.0 applications by intercepting DirectX API calls.

The complete frame geometry is reconstructed and imported into 3ds Max, allowing rendered scenes to be inspected and analyzed in detail.

Originally designed as an analysis and debugging tool for programmers, it unexpectedly gained widespread popularity among 3D artists due to its ability to reconstruct full scenes inside 3ds Max.

    This unit allows your program to store data files in the form of
lzh archives. The advantages of storing data in archive form are undeniable.

The module contains only one procedure:

 UnPackFile (Arcname,FileName: String; Buffer: Pointer; var Len: LongInt);

It unpacks the file FileName from the archive ArcName into the memory area
Buffer; the length of the unpacked file is returned in Len.
  If an error occurred during unpacking (archive not found, file not found
in archive, checksum error) - Len = -1;
  If there was not enough memory (the unpacker requires 65535 bytes in Heap) -
Len = -2.
  You are responsible for the size of Buffer yourself - the procedure unpacks
the file completely, and the file size can be larger than one segment.

   The archive must be created with the LHA packer; I tried version 2.55b -
everything works well. The LHIce packer cannot be used because it uses
methods 0-4, while my unpacker only handles 0 and 5.
   The unpacker is written in assembler and provides very fast speed,
practically the same as during normal file loading.
   The only drawback of the module is the inability to pack a file into an
archive from the program - but please excuse me, extracting the packing
procedure from a packer longer than 40K is not an easy task (whereas I
extracted the unpacking procedure from a SELF-EXTRACTING archive); and
anyway, what are we talking about?

   The source code, I believe, can be recompiled for any version of Pascal.

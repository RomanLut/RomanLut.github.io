Library for unpacking *.lzh archives. Actually dissasembled and turned to library a stub of self-extracting archive.

Based on this library, I also made a tricky program which could launch a program directly from archive (all file-access functions were emulated and redirected to unpacking code. Unfortunately, sources and program itself have been lost 🙁

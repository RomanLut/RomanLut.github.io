Speech syntesis on PC Speaker. In 1995, sound blaster compartible card was a high-tech product and was not affordable. I developed a dedeicated hardware for sampling 1-bit sounds from microphone. This program uses library of pre-recorded phonemes to read text files on PC Speaker.

**Russian text is supported only.**

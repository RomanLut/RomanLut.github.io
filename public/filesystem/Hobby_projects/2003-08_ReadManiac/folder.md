**ReadManiac**

**Date:** 2003-2006  
**Platform:** JAVA-enabled phones (J2ME MIDP1.0, 2.0)  
**Language:** J2ME, Delphi

In 2002, mobile phones became capable of running small Java applications.
Naturally, I couldn’t miss the opportunity to create software for mobile devices. When the first Java-enabled phones appeared on the market, I bought an “early bird” Siemens SL42 and began developing a book reader application.
ReadManiac is a book reader MIDlet for mobile phones. It allows users to search, download, and read books on virtually any Java-enabled device.
The first version was compatible only with the SL42, but it quickly evolved into a large, full-featured, and user-friendly application that supported most J2ME-enabled phones.
**In 2006, ReadManiac won 3rd place in the JavaKonkurs competition, sponsored by Sun Microsystems.**
Today, the era of Java-enabled phones has ended. This folder contains an archive of the ReadManiac installation files, source code, and website.

**White Gold: War in Paradise** (**Xenus II: Белое золото**, **Xenus II: White Gold**) is the sequel or possibly prequel to the 2005 video game [Boiling Point: Road to Hell](http://localhost:5173/?start=2&folder=Work_Projects%2F2005-05_Xenus_Boiling_Point). **White Gold** was developed by Ukrainian game studio **Deep Shadows**. 

**Xenus** gameplay is a combination of first-person shooter and role-playing video game mechanics, set in an open world. 

The game was developed by core team of 15 people, 30 people at peak.

**My role**: Lead Graphics Engine programming, Level Editor/Tools programming, XBOX 360 port.

In 2009, **Deep Shadows** had working XBOX 360 prototype. Due to a crysis in the game industry in 2009, XBOX 360 development was cancelled.

**Xenus 2** is the best game by **Deep Shadows**. I am proud to have been a core member of the **Xenus 2** development team. I truly love this game and would still play it with the same excitement even after 20 years.

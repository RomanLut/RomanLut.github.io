**The Precursors** is a 2009 first-person shooter game developed by Ukrainian game studio **Deep Shadows**. The game was released for Windows in Russia on 4 December 2009. It was then released worldwide through GamersGate on 21 December 2010 and through Steam on 4 February 2017. 

The Precursors is a sci-fi game that combines shooting, RPG, and space simulation in an open galaxy. Players explore four main planets and several space locations, complete quests, and fight enemies on foot and in space. 

The game was developed by core team of 15 people, 30 people at peak.

Due to a crysis in the game industry in 2009, it required a great effort to release this game.

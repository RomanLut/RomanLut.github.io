**Vital Engine ZL** is Game Engine developed by **Sergey Zabaryansky** and **Roman Lut**. This game engine was used in:

[Venom: Codename Outbreak](/?start=2&folder=Work_projects%2F2001-08_Venom_Codename_Outbreak)
[Xenus: Boiling Point](/?start=2&folder=Work_projects%2F2005-05_Xenus_Boiling_Point)
[Xenus 2: Road To Hell](/?start=2&folder=Work_projects%2F2008-10_Xenus_2_White_Gold)
[The Partisans](/?start=2&folder=Work_projects%2F2010-01_The_Partisans_Prototype)

We started engine development in 1998 and created a technical demo showcasing the engine’s graphics and physics features. With this demo, we approached **GSC Game World**, where **Venom** was developed and released.

After the release of **Venom**, we left **GSC Game World** and founded our own company, **Deep Shadows**, where **Xenus**, **Xenus 2**, and **The Precursors** were developed and released.

Due to a crisis in the game industry, development of **Vital Engine ZL** was stopped in 2010.

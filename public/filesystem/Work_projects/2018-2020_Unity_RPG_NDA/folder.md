**Training application**

I worked on a personnel training application for a well-known brand (NDA), delivered as a 3D FPS/RPG experience in a photorealistic environment.

The application featured extensive interactive dialogues, where facial animation was a core component. We developed a neural-network–based tool for automatic recognition of phonemes, head and body poses, and eyebrow movements from recorded actor videos, enabling realistic character animation during conversations.

In 1996-1997, I, Roman Lut (aka Hax), together with Eugene Babich (aka Dem), worked as a demo group called **“The Nephilims.”** During that time, we created several demos and participated in demoscene events.

Today, running these demos requires almost a “stone-age” setup, as most of them depend on pure DOS and are affected by the well-known Borland **“Runtime Error 200”** issue.

Fortunately, modern PCs are more than 1000 times faster than the machines we used back then. Thanks to this, the original demos can now be run directly in a web browser using a [DOS emulator](https://js-dos.com/v7/build/docs/).

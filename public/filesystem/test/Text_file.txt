Once upon a time, in a small village nestled on the edge of a vast, emerald-green forest, there lived a sweet young girl who was loved by everyone who knew her. Her grandmother, who lived in a secluded cottage deep within the woods, had given her a beautiful riding hood made of the finest crimson velvet. The girl loved it so much that she wore it every single day, and soon enough, the villagers began to call her Little Red Riding Hood.

One sunny morning, her mother called her into the kitchen, which was filled with the warm scent of baking. "My dear," her mother said, carefully packing a wicker basket. "Your grandmother is feeling quite poorly and weak. I have packed some fresh honey cakes and a bottle of wine to help her regain her strength. Take this to her cottage, but I must warn you: stay strictly on the well-trodden path. Do not wander off, and whatever you do, do not speak to any strangers you might encounter." Little Red Riding Hood kissed her mother goodbye and promised to be careful and obedient.

The air in the forest was crisp and cool, and the sunlight filtered through the ancient oak trees in long, golden shafts. Red Riding Hood walked along, enjoying the birdsong, but she hadn't gone very far when a large, grey wolf stepped out from behind a thicket. He didn't look particularly frightening at first; in fact, he spoke with a polite, deep voice. "Good morning, little one. Where might you be heading on such a fine day?" Forgetful of her mother's stern warning, she replied, "I am going to my grandmother's house. She lives just beyond the three large oak trees by the stream." The wolf’s yellow eyes gleamed with a hungry light. He suggested that she might want to pick some of the beautiful wildflowers growing nearby to cheer up her grandmother. While the girl wandered off the path to gather a bouquet of daisies and bluebells, the wolf took a shortcut, running as fast as his legs could carry him toward the old woman’s cottage.

Arriving at the cottage, the wolf knocked softly. "Who is it?" called the grandmother feebly. Mimicking the girl's high-pitched voice, the wolf replied, "It is I, Little Red Riding Hood, with cakes and wine." The grandmother, thinking it was her granddaughter, told him to pull the bobbin and the latch would go up. The wolf burst inside and, before the poor woman could scream, swallowed her whole. He then quickly donned her spare nightcap and gown, climbed into her bed, and pulled the quilts up to his chin, waiting patiently.

When Little Red Riding Hood finally arrived and entered the cottage, she felt a strange sense of unease. The room was dark, and her grandmother looked quite different. "Oh, Grandmother," she whispered, stepping closer to the bed. "What big ears you have!" "The better to hear you with, my dear," the wolf replied in a raspy voice. "But Grandmother, what big eyes you have!" "The better to see you with, my child." "And Grandmother... what big teeth you have!" "THE BETTER TO EAT YOU WITH!" With a ferocious roar, the wolf leaped from the bed and swallowed the poor girl in a single gulp.

Fortunately, a woodsman was passing by the cottage and heard the strange commotion. He rushed inside and saw the wolf sleeping soundly, his belly bloated and moving. Realizing what had happened, he used his sharp axe to carefully open the wolf. To his amazement, out stepped Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother, both shaken but completely unharmed. They quickly filled the wolf’s belly with heavy stones and sewed him back up. When the wolf finally woke and tried to run away, the weight of the stones was so great that he collapsed and could haunt the forest no more. From that day forward, Little Red Riding Hood never strayed from the path again, always remembering that even the softest voice can sometimes hide the sharpest teeth.

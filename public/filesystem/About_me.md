Let me introduce myself. My name is Roman Lut. I was born in Ukraine in 1975.

I am a TypeScript and C++ programmer with over 25 years of experience in the game development industry. For more details, please see my portfolio.

I maintain multiple open-source projects on Github.

Working at a game development company leaves little free time. Nevertheless, I still dedicate several hours each week to my hobby projects.

Current interests:
- Embedded programming and microcontrollers
- LLM and AI automation
- RC planes
- Robotics

Former interests:
* 3D graphics engine programming
* Virtual reality
* Homemade CNC
* GPGPU
* Distributed and multi-core programming
* Demo design
* DIY electronics

While reviewing my hobby projects, I realized that I had lost a significant amount of source code over the years. To prevent this from happening again, I decided to create this archive.

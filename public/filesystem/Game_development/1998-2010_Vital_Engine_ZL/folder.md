**Vital Engine ZL** is Game Engine developed by **Sergey Zabaryansky** and **Roman Lut**. This game engine was used in:

[Venom: Codename Outbreak](/Game_development/2001-08_Venom_Codename_Outbreak/)
[Xenus: Boiling Point](/Game_development\2005-05_Xenus_Boiling_Point/)
[Xenus 2: Road To Hell](/Game_development/2008-10_Xenus_2_White_Gold/)
[The Partisans](/Game_development/2009-10_The_Precursors/)

We started engine development in 1998 and made  techincal demo which demosntrated graphics and phicis feautes of engine. With this demo we come to **GSC Game World** where **Venom** was developed and released.
After **Venom** release, we left **GSC Game World** and founded our own company **Deep Shadows**, where **Xenus**, **Xenus 2** and **The Precursors** were developed and relased.

Due to a crisis in game industry, **Vital Engine ZL** development was stopped in 2010.

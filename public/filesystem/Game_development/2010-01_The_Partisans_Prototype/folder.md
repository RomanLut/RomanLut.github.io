**The Partisans** is a first-person shooter game developed by Ukrainian game studio **Deep Shadows** for PC and XBOX 360. The game was cancelled because **Deep Shadows** was not able to find funding due to crysis in the game industry in 2009.

The prototype was developed by a team of 5 people.

**My role**: Lead Graphics Engine programming, Level Editor/Tools programming.

# About me

<img src="/images/romanluthax.jpg" width="20%" align="right">

Let me introduce myself. My name is Roman Lut. I was born in Ukraine in 1975.

I am a programmer with over 25 years of experience in the game development industry. For more details, please see my portfolio.

I maintain multiple open-source projects on Github.

Working at a game development company leaves little free time. Nevertheless, I still dedicate several hours each week to my hobby projects.

Current interests:
- Game engines
- Embedded programming and microcontrollers
- LLMs and AI automation
- RC planes
- DIY electronics
- Robotics

Former interests:
- 3D graphics engine programming
- Virtual reality
- Homemade CNC
- GPGPU
- Distributed and multi-core programming
- Demo design

While reviewing my hobby projects, I realized that I had lost a significant amount of source code over the years. To prevent this from happening again, I decided to create this archive.

Technologies evolve rapidly, and many materials on this site are now outdated. Materials that are still relevant or that demonstrate my skills are marked with a red star.
